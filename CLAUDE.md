- [ ] AI-powered diagnosis assistance
- [ ] 3D volume rendering for CBCT
- [ ] PACS integration
- [ ] Appointment scheduling
- [ ] Billing integration
- [ ] SMS/Email notifications
- [ ] Backup automation

### Current Limitations
- MPR view is simulated (not true volume reconstruction)
- 3D rendering requires additional libraries (VTK.js)
- Large DICOM series may impact performance
- Mobile responsiveness needs optimization

## Maintenance Notes
